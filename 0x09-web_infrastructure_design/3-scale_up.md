# Scale Up
![Web Infrastructure](https://github.com/alxandrkgb/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/3-scale_up.jpg) 



## Description

This is a design of a a setup with separate servers for each component: web server, application server, and database. We will also include a load balancer (HAproxy) configured as a cluster with another load balancer for high availability.



## Specifics About The Infrastructure

- One Server
We are using one server to host each component (web server, application server, and database). Separating these components into different servers allows for better resource allocation, isolation, and scalability. It also helps to prevent one component from impacting the performance of others.

- Load Balancer (HAproxy) Cluster
We are configuring two HAproxy load balancers as a cluster for high availability and fault tolerance. In a cluster setup, if one load balancer fails, the other can take over the traffic distribution, ensuring uninterrupted service.

- Split Components on Separate Servers
We are placing each component (web server, application server, and database) on its own dedicated server to improve performance and security. Separating the components allows for better resource allocation and isolation. For example, the web server can focus solely on handling HTTP requests, the application server on processing business logic, and the database on managing data.

- Separating components on individual servers allows for better resource utilization and scaling. It also improves isolation, preventing issues with one component from affecting others.

- Configuring HAproxy as a load balancer cluster ensures high availability and fault tolerance. If one load balancer fails, the other can seamlessly take over, minimizing downtime.
